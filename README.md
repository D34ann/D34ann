# 👋 Hi there

I'm a developer passionate about game scripting, backend systems, and full stack development. I started coding with PAWN for SA-MP, then expanded into web tech like JavaScript and backend tools like Node.js and C++.

I enjoy building systems from scratch, whether it's a roleplay server mechanic or a real-time API. I believe in writing clean code, staying consistent, and learning every day.
