# 👋 Hi there

I'm **Defann Rizki Utomo**, a curious learner exploring the world of programming and game development. Right now, I'm **learning** various technologies — starting from PAWN scripting for SA-MP, and moving into backend development with C++, JavaScript, and Node.js.

I believe learning is a journey. It’s okay to make mistakes, as long as I keep moving forward and stay consistent.
